<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Football Registration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36320943/153801178-3509bb22-bc66-4736-a97e-4b52226ba1e5.png)

Preparing a Football Registration Form in which the user will be able to enter various details to register for a Football tournament.

What's inside:

- The user will be required to input various details such as "First name", "Email", "Desired position", etc.
- After submitting the form, a message will show up that the form has been submitted and then repopulate data in the form for the user to edit the fields.
- After retrieval, if the user edits any field and submit, then the already existing entries in the database are updated. Finally a message that the form has been updated is shown.

Of course, a lot of other things are there, but will know more about them later ðŸ˜‰

### Additional dependencies

- [CountriesNow API](https://countriesnow.space), for Countries, States, Cities and their dial codes.
- [Spring data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa), provides abstraction that makes working with the JPA provider less verbose.
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org), for minimizing/removing the boilerplate code.
- [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org), for sanitizing untrusted HTML (to prevent XSS).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is how we can set things up to be able to run it locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, we need to set few things up.

1. Make sure you have JDK 11+ and related path in place and could confirm this

   ```sh
   java --version
   ```

2. Make sure you have Microsoft SQL Server installed and then setup the database
   - Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
   - From the side panel, right click Databases and select New Database.
   - Name the database as `football_registration`
   - And finally, you need to your db credentials in `application.properties` file.
   - Alternatively, you can specify your existing database and make changes to `application.properties` file accordingly.
3. Make sure you have an IDE available as well, preferably IntelliJ IDEA to ease up things a lot.

And now we are ready to roll.

### Installation

So, this is how we can install and set things up.

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/amarjeetmalpotra/football-registration-form.git
   ```

2. Open the directory `football-registration-form` as a project in IntelliJ IDEA

3. You can now straight away Run or Debug from the top left corner in IntelliJ IDEA

4. For non IntelliJ IDEA users or to run from command line

   ```sh
   gradlew bootRun
   ```

5. Open your favourite web browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`

And this should bring you to the registration form ðŸ˜‰

### A word of warning!

In `application.properties` file, Hibernate ddl auto is set to `create-drop` which is for development use, for production consider setting it to `validate` or just remove that property.
